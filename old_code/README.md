This is the old code, where I explored:
1. Data preprocessing 
2. Fitting models to the data to get resource consumption rates, competition, intrinsic growth rates.
3. Theoretical population models to match the empirical data.
4. Dynamic Information Theory metrics for both the empirical data sets and the theoretical data.
