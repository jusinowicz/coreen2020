Using any sort of NLS approach to fit the non-linear population growth rate function
(e.g. a Leslie-Gower model) is tricky. NLS tends to: 
1. Fail if starting parameter values are not close to final values. 
2. Give biologically unreasonable parameter values if the time-series of invasion are not 
	carefully windowed
3. Have a really hard time when both alpha_ii and alpha_ij are in the same model. 

# As the code is currently written, NLS can barely handle fitting most of 
# the replicates. It often seems to fail when the data should be "easiest"
# to interpret, and maybe this makes sense. For example, it is bad at fitting
# the model parameters when Daphnia is the resident and quickly reaches its 
# equilibrium abundance: most of the variation is likely due to (AR) noise. 

Windowing the data so that it is constrained to important periods of population growth in each species -- i.e. pre-invasion for the resident, and a precise invasion period for the invader -- minimizes errors and gives the best fits. In this case, single-alpha models can be used (only alpha_ii * N_res for the resident and alpha_ij*N_res for the invader) that tend to fit better and actually converge. However, what is needed is a rigorous and automated way to identify the "pre-invasion" and "invasion" periods. 

For the invader, this period is identified by the log-linear period of growth. But how to automate a way to identify this period?
